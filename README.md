A simple fractal viewer implemented in [PureScript][] and [purescript-halogen][], primarily as an exercise to familiarize myself with Halogen.

Note that all the real meat of the Fractal.purs was adapted from a [post](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/06/06/fractal-trees-with-purescript/) by Mark Seemann. The main "original" work here is in the Halogen components.

[PureScript]: https://purescript.org/
[purescript-halogen]: https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen/

## Usage

```
npm run build
open dist/index.html
```

Then play with the sliders.
