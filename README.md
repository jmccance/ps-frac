=======

A simple fractal viewer implemented in [PureScript][] and [purescript-halogen][]. Note that all the real meat of the viewer was adapted from a [post](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/06/06/fractal-trees-with-purescript/) by Mark Seemann. The main work here was (finally) taking the time to (start) understanding Halogen.

[PureScript]: https://purescript.org/
[purescript-halogen]: https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen/

## Usage

```
npm run build
open dist/index.html
```

Then play with the sliders.
